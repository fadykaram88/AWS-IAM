Project 1 Exploring AWS Identity and Access Management  (IAM)
0 - Search about IAM then create users 
1 - create user 1 
2 - create user 2 
3 - create user 3 
note : when you create the users give them access to the AWS management console
other note : don't forget to write the password in the Clipboard as you will you need it later   
4-  go to user groups and create 3 groups which are 
EC2-admin
EC2-support 
S3-support  
5- choose EC2-support 
give him policy (AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess )
AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess : it allows him to see a lot of 
AWS resources like EC2 and S3 and CloudWatch and EC2 Auto scaling  but not to create or modify any resource 
6- after adding the Policy go to the name of the policy and choose it then other page will be opened then choose JSON 
you will see 
Effect : says whether to allow or deny the permission 
Action : specify the API calls that can be made against an AWS service 
Resource : it defines the scope of the policy to the User 

7- go back and choose S3-support 
8- add permission by choosing attach policy and choose AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess 
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess : this policy gives the user the permission to see and list S3 buckets without ability to modify or delete or create new one . 

9 - go back then choose EC2-Admin
choose new permission and add EC2-Admin-Policy 
a Question to you 
what does this policy mean ??????????????????????

now we want to add the users to the groups we created so how ?
we will add user-1 to S3-Support  and user-2 to EC2-support and user-3 to EC2-Admin 

10 - in the left you will see User groups so choose it 
11 - choose S3-Support 
12 - add users 
13 - choose user-1 and choose add user
14 - same steps in the other groups 

15 - what if I want to open AWS Console as a user-1 not a root ?
first write in the Search IAM 
then go to users 
then choose user-1 then choose Security credentials 
16 - you will see Console sign-in link 
17 - take the link URL 
18 - open any private tap and open the link 
19 - write user-1 in IAM username 
20 - write the password you have written when you have created in the starting 
then sign in 
21 - write in the search bar S3 
note : if there is any S3 bucket , I am sure you can see it as you have the permission to see it not to create or modify or delete it 
but there are no S3 buckets as I don't have the permission to create new one .

22 - sign out 
23 - log in again as a root 
24 - search about IAM 
25 - choose users and choose user-3 then Security credentials 
26 - copy Console sing-in link URL and copy it in other tap 
27 - write user-3 in IAM username and write the password you have created in the starting 
28 - write in the search EC2  then choose instances (running) then choose launch instance  
29 - as user-3 you have a permission to stop any instance but unfortunately there is no instance to delete it as you don't have permission to create it ...
30 - I am so happy if get any info from me 
31 - good bye and see you soon in other project
